## Description

Keeps track of files that you want to backup. It does so by storing their path, so that it easily can be retrieved at a later point. Also has the ability to check the validity of the paths, and also to remove any path that is no longer valid.

The script is intended to use in parallell to backing up system and/or application files, by piping the output of list (`trackup.sh --list`) to a backup application or solution of choice.

*All tracked files will be stored in a plain text file at location `~/.local/bin/trackup.sh.list`. It is this file that the script operates on.*

## Installation

This is an example of how to setup and use the script. Do note that it is nothing more than a script and that there are several ways to set things up. 

##### Put the script file in location of choice. I use `~/.local/bin`:
````
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && mv /path/to/trackup.sh ~/.local/bin
````

##### Make sure it is executable:
````
$ chmod u+x ~/.local/bin/trackup.sh
````

##### (*Optional*) Put location in `PATH` variable:
````
$ export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
````

##### (*Optional*) Create an alias for the script:
````
$ echo "alias trackup='trackup.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc
````

## Usage
````
trackup.sh [-hlsc][-ar arg]
````
  
## Examples

##### Show current tracking status
````
  $ trackup.sh --status
  [+] "/path/to/someotherfile" 
  [+] "/just/a/file"
````

##### Add a new file to be tracked:
````
  $ trackup.sh --add somefile
  [+] "/path/to/somefile" 
````

##### Show current tracking status (after a file has been removed)
````
  $ rm /path/to/somefile
  $ trackup.sh --status
  [ ] "/path/to/somefile" 
  [+] "/path/to/someotherfile" 
  [+] "/just/a/file"
````

##### Clean all non-valid paths and display all tracked paths after this operation:
````
  $ trackup.sh -cl
  Cleaned out 1 entry
  /path/to/someotherfile /just/a/file
````

##### Copy all tracked files to another location
````
  $ mkdir -p ~/tmp/test
  $ cp $(trackup.sh --list) /tmp/test/
  $ ls /tmp/test
  file    someotherfile
````
    
## Options

  `-h, --help`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;displays the help section  
  `-l, --list`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prints all stored paths to stdout  
  `-s, --status`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checks the validity of each stored path  
  `-a, --add <PATH>`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add a new file to be tracked  
  `-r, --remove <PATH>`&nbsp;&nbsp;removes a previously tracked file  
  `-c, --clean`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will remove any stored path that is not valid  
  
## Good to know ðŸ’¡
In compliance with [POSIX standards](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html), combined short options are allowed: `-cl` will be interpreted the same way as `--clean --list`.

The commands will be performed in a fixed order, no matter which order you enter them:
1. Show help (and then exit)
2. List file status
3. Clean tracked files
4. List files
5. Add files
6. Remove files

## Todo
* Handle how symlinks are handled
